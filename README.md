# DrawingFlowersWithPython

Here, I used the library "turtle" to design 3 different flowers of varying petals and color. 

This library can be found here:

By turning an angle at 180 degrees, I was able to use the turtle function to manipulate the drawing turtle into creating the items I defined: flower, petal, and move.

In addition, I was able to define the colors and shapes, as well as move the turtle onto the next flower.

This project assists further in my understanding of Python, how functions are created and defined, as well as how to apply a library to a segment of code.
